/**
 * This is a prototype application *just* showing how to integrate a MapComponent with an existing
 * application.
 * <p>
 * As such the details of this application are not all that interesting; they do serve to illustrate
 * how to:
 * <ol>
 * <li>set up a MapComponent (this is actually a simple JPanel consisting of a JMapPane</li>
 * <li>set up a toolbar using some of the actions available for controlling MapComponent</li>
 * </ul> * In all cases this is straight forward application of the components provided by GeoTools.
 * <p>
 * Here is the interesting bit:
 * <ul>
 * <li>set up a FaceTable (actually a small JPanel consisting of a JTable working against
 * the MapComponentImpl)</li>
 * <li>Custom table model; just backed by the Faces provided to MapComponentTable</li>
 * <li>Custom tool to "select" Faces in the MapComponent; this will update both update an internal
 * *filter* used to display selected faces; and send a FaceTable update event</li>
 * <li>Custom DataStore used to present the Faces provided to MapComponent to the GeoTools rendering
 * system. This is used by *two* layers. One layer to display the sites; and a second to display the
 * selection (These two layerss are added to the MapContent).</li>
 * </ul>>

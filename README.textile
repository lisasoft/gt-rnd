h1. Welcome to the LISAsoft RnD repository

This repository is used for quick notes and scratch pad ideas; sometimes with
customer collaboration.

LISAsoft provides developer support for many open source applications; this
repository is devoted to helping development teams integrate GeoTools
with their own applications.

Examples currently under construction:

* "ContentDataStore Tutorial":http://docs.geotools.org/latest/userguide/tutorial/advanced/contentdatastore.html
  
* "Face Prototype":https://github.com/lisasoft/gt-rnd/tree/master/prototype/face

We do our best to contribute code examples back to the GeoTools documentation, and
would like to thank our customers both for their business and for supporting
open source development.

.. note::
   
   Unless otherwise noted GeoTools documentation examples of this nature are provided

   our method for ensuring we meet the requirements of source disclosure required by LGPL.
